Microservice saga design pattern implementation

### Saga Design Pattern
The Saga Design Pattern is a distributed transaction pattern used in microservices architectures to manage complex and long-running business transactions while maintaining data consistency and integrity. It helps address the challenges of maintaining atomicity and consistency in a distributed system where multiple services need to collaborate to complete a single transaction.

#### Problem Statement
In a microservices architecture, each service manages its own database, which can lead to challenges in maintaining consistency when multiple services need to participate in a single business transaction. Traditional two-phase commit protocols are not well-suited for distributed systems due to their blocking nature and potential for single points of failure.

#### Solution
The Saga pattern addresses the distributed transaction challenge by breaking down a complex business transaction into a sequence of smaller, localized transactions (also known as saga steps). Each step corresponds to a service's local transaction. If a step fails, compensating actions are executed to undo the changes made by previous steps.

The Saga pattern provides two ways to manage sagas:

**Choreography**: In choreography, each service involved in the saga knows its own responsibilities and communicates directly with other services to coordinate the saga steps. Events are used to trigger and communicate between services.

**Orchestration**: In orchestration, a central coordinator (often called the "orchestrator") is responsible for sequencing and coordinating the saga steps. The orchestrator communicates with each service to instruct them on their tasks.

#### Key Concepts
Saga Steps: These are individual transactions that make up the saga. Each step is a task performed by a single service.

**Compensating Actions**: If a step fails or if the saga needs to be rolled back, compensating actions are executed to undo the effects of the completed steps.

**State Management**: The current state of the saga is tracked to ensure that steps are executed in the correct sequence and that the saga can be resumed or compensated as needed.

#### Benefits
Distributed Consistency: The Saga pattern ensures consistency and data integrity across multiple services within a distributed system.

**Decoupled Services**: Services can operate independently without tightly coupled dependencies, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

**Failure Handling**: The pattern provides a mechanism to handle failures gracefully, minimizing the impact of partial failures.

**Flexibility**: Sagas allow for different services to be written in different languages and use different databases, enabling a diverse technology stack.

Considerations
Eventual Consistency: Sagas do not provide immediate consistency. Depending on the approach (choreography or orchestration), eventual consistency may be achieved at the end of the saga.

Compensating Actions: Designing and implementing compensating actions can be complex and require careful consideration.

Saga Execution Order: Ensuring the correct order of saga steps and managing failures can be challenging.

#### Use Cases
E-commerce: Managing the process of placing an order, checking inventory, processing payments, and updating shipping status.

Travel Booking: Coordinating the booking of flights, hotels, and car rentals while handling possible failures at each step.

Financial Transactions: Handling multi-step financial transactions that involve multiple accounts and systems.

#### Example
Consider an e-commerce application where a user places an order. The saga involves multiple steps:

Order Creation: The order service creates an order and reserves the items.
Payment Processing: The payment service processes the payment.
Inventory Update: The inventory service updates the stock.
Shipping: The shipping service ships the items.
If any step fails, compensating actions are triggered. For example, if the payment fails, the order is canceled, and the items are returned to inventory.

#### Conclusion
The Saga Design Pattern provides an effective way to manage distributed transactions in microservices architectures. By breaking down complex business transactions into smaller steps and using compensating actions, sagas ensure data consistency and integrity in a decentralized and highly distributed environment.
